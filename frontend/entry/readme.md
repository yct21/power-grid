# frontend/entry

This directory consists of files that are all the entries of frontend, including:

- `index.ts`: The entry JS of application
- `index.html`: Template HTML of application
- `store`: The complete part of store
- `MainComponent`: The component that initialize application store and hooks itself to `#app` in the page.

Since we already have much configuration files in `<project_root>/frontend`,
I'm gonna put entry of frontend here.
