# frontend/entry

This directory consists of files that are the entries of frontend, including:

- `index.ts`: The entry JS of application
- `MainComponent.ts`: The component that initialize application store and hooks
  itself to `#app` in the page.
- `index.html`: Template HTML of application

Since we already have multiple configuration files in `<project_root>/frontend`,
I'm gonna put entry of frontend here.
